# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second heading

- Unordered lists, and:
  1. One
  2. Two
  3. Three
- And more

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_.

[A link] (https://markdowntohtml.com)

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
    return foo + ':' + 's';
}
```

The end ...
